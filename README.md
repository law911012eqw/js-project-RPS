# js-project-RPS
Description: A javascript project consisting of three buttons called Rock, paper and scissors; a battle of luck against the programmed computer. 

### Main sections
1. The interactive section - This section is mainly for interaction. It is the emphasized or required blocks of code on this project. 
2. Statistics section - This section is optional. It is a section solely for myself to practice function loops, mathematical formulas, and some other functions that may be needed for it to work on its proper state.

### Desired features to be fully synthesized as a simplified programmed webpage game
1. Having to choose a different number of rounds such as 5 or 9 rounds in one game. (Done)
2. A feature that displays the result of outcomes in a list format with less-than-a-second transitional animation below the player's side in the RPS main element and updates every click. (Later)
3. A colored table grid that displays the number of wins for both parties (player, COM) [Later]
4. Displays statistical data below the webpage. (Partial)

#### Main Goal
My main goal for this project is too maintain an approximate ideal percentages (or more specifically around 50|30|20) among js, css and javascript as can be seen in the right side section of the repository main page where it indicates the percentage of languages used. Additionally, I wanted to achieve ideal aspects of this project to meet its functionality at least of its 80% according to my subjective calculation.
